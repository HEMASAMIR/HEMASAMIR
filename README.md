# Hi there 👋

I'm Ibrahim, a passionate **Flutter Developer** with over two years of hands-on experience building high-quality, scalable, and user-focused mobile applications.  

Throughout my journey, I've worked on multiple real projects—ranging from social media apps to e-commerce and real-time chat systems—focusing on performance, clean architecture, and an excellent user experience.

I always aim to write maintainable, testable, and clean code while following best practices such as SOLID, separation of concerns, and layered architecture.  
I enjoy transforming ideas into smooth, reliable, and visually polished mobile apps.
